            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

In this sense, what may we not see and sayâ–ª in and of those now newly return'd, and we hope true assertors of that Cause of God and their Countrey cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, betwixt those two State-Thieves, Ambition and Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice; wherein who would not be sharers with them in their wants and hazards, as otherwayes ready to reward their

            <p>Now that I may draw nearer to what I intend to retrive, and what (for these five years last) we have lost, to wit, our Laws and Liberties, our Credit and Consciences; Let us take notice by the way of those Ecclesiasticall, Civil, and Military Apostates, who hitherto have thought to make themselves happy by making us miserable. Is not now their successe likely to prove suitable to their sin? and will they not be sooner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated then detected? how tottering stand the Thrones ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by Treason or Usurpation? who can love or cherish the best remainders of such as by their Treacheries and Cruelties, have in this kind constrained us unto fear or hate? Let then such dependents perish with their principall, as in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe of their contrivances, have no other point but what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Shall not Crowns, Scepters, painted Sepulchers, and parasiticall Pageantries perish, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perpetuate the memory of their perfidious practises, whilst every passenger shall with a pointing-finger proclaim, There lies a filthy carkasse under a fair stone, or an <hi>English</hi> Monster under a Marble monument? To such, gay and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous sepulchres are but marks of infamy, whilst every good man's tongue and pen's the true Patriot's Elegy and Epitaph: but the pain abated (which by sense of losse brought paleness into so many faces) we expect an interrupted circulation of the life-blood of our Liberties refluxing into its former cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel; so that surely now the condition of all our new obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons runs not for selfish Soveraignty, but for the <hi>Good old Cause,</hi> and the executing of all our former Oathes and Engagements. It will now be expected (if ever) that all projects of profit and preferment, must rather be parted with then stoopt unto: We are not now for, but against any single Soveraigne, and we

Ambition and Usurpation are ever of a selfâ–ª consuming nature: such are often more glorious in Hearse then History; and their memories rather want an Elegy, then their graves an Epitaph, or their names red Letters in times anniverse. O miserable and wretched estate of mankind, who cannot modell his deepest designes to secure himself or any of his curiously contrived cobwebs, against one coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terblast of providence!

Thus Pride and Ambition makes many shining lights prove smoaking fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands, that their posterity (<hi>Actaeon</hi>-like) may be eaten up
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:39627:4"/> of their own hounds; and that Historians pens (being long kept fasting) may feed more mercilesly on their memories. Such Usurpers and perfidious betrayers of their Countrey, in the end want a Guard to guard them from their guard. For every King of hate, is a slave of fear: how then in vain do they seek to fence themselves without, whose greatest Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are within? how do such patch up sleep?

            <p>Then let not <hi>England</hi> measure her Armyes loyalty by the successe of these last 5. yeares: None layes the unexpected rubbs in the Alley to the Bowlers fault, who takes good aim, though he misses the mark: It's known with whom they and we had to deal: As his life of late was a mirrour of perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Hypocrisie (who by acting the white devils part did undo us) so was his death, of Gods patience: Indeed it is strange his Tragicall acts should have a Comicall end; or that he who sent so many to their graves in wrath, should go to his own in peace: but Gods justice on offenders goes not ever in one and the same path or pace; he is not pardon'd for his fault, who is for a while reprieved from the punishment. Sometimes the Guest in the Inne goes quietly to bed before the reckoning is paid. But now to prevent all despairings, let none truly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent fear a pardon from the good old Parliament. Let one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly such as still oppose it, the purging of the Army, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>investing of our good old faithfull officers, fear what shall follow or befall them; so that if yet we dare be honest and resolute, freedome will fall upon its feet: we have been often foil'd, but we shall never be defeated: Down then with all selfish and irreconcileable designers; trample under foot their Mushroom honours, who to advance their personall power, and to paint the plumes of present oppressours, would rob us of the price and purchase of our bloody and dear-bought Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties:
